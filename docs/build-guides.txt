     NW.js app build guide
/////////////////////////////////

So easy to build app, you just follow the steps below.

1. First of all, get prepared nwjs sdk-v0.20.3
   Should be downloaded on
	https://dl.nwjs.io/v0.20.3/nwjs-sdk-v0.20.3-win-ia32.zip

2. On Windows and Linux, you can put the files of your app in the same folder of NW.js binaries and then ship them to your users.
Make sure  nw(or 'nw.exe') is in the same folder as 'package.json'.
Or you can put the files of your app in a folder named  'package.nw'  in the same folder as  nw(or 'nw.exe').

3. Package source files.
You can package all the files into a zip file and rename it as 'package.nw'. And put it along with NW.js binaries for Windows and Linux. For Mac, put  package.nw  in 'nwjs.app/Contents/Resources/'.

4. Append source to binary
On Windows and Linux, you can even hide the zip file by appending the zip file to the end of nw or 'nw.exe'.
You can run following command on Windows to achieve this:
	copy /b nw.exe+package.nw app.exe
or following command on Linux:
	cat nw app.nw > app && chmod +x app

Enjoy it.
