# About CASE Web Builder
There are lots of web design tool to build a responsive websites with Bootstrap framework, such as Pinegrow and Bootstrap Studio. However, the tools are just offering a user interface to drag out the HTML controls and build a web page without cooperating with any database table.
As such, the goal of this project is to build a web design tool which is working with a database. The web design tool should use NW.JS to develop.
